Context of project : 
Now that we have managed to manage the products of a store, the next step is the management of employees of different stores.
there are 3 types of employees (Cashier, Manager and Salesperson), knowing
that an employee is characterized by an identifier, a name, an address and a
nbr_hours per month, with a maximum of 20 employees per store, this
module must allow the addition of different types of employees in order to
assign to a store, while taking into account that a seller is characterized
also by a SalesRate, a cashier by a CashNumber and a
responsible by a prime.
